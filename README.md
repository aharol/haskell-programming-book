Haskell Programming: from first principles
---

These are my solutions to the [book](http://haskellbook.com). In general all of the solutions were put in `src/ChXX.hs`. Some of the solutions per chapter were split up so I didn't have overlapping implementations.

The projects in the book which are separate applications all have their own subfolders, such as `hangman` or `morse`.

I don't have solutions for anything before Chapter 9, mostly because I already knew a bit of haskell coming into this and those chapters were very easy.

I hope these solutions are of use to someone, feel free to PR if you come across any errors.
